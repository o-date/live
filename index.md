# Hi!

The source code for our first [beta release](https://github.com/o-date/draft/releases) is now available (including electron-powered apps for off-line use).

The online live-written open accessible **perpetual beta** can be [explored here](http://o-date.github.io/draft/book)(https://o-date.github.io/draft/book).

You can learn more about how to use the text and its 20+ Jupyter Notebooks [on the support site](https://o-date.github.io/support).
