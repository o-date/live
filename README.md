# Hi!

You've found the location for our released version of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook. We anticipate releasing version 1.0 in the fall of 2018.

The live-written open accessible **draft** can be [explored here](http://o-date.github.io/draft/book).

You can learn more about how to use the text and it's 20+ Jupyter Notebooks [on the support site](https://o-date.github.io/support).
